## The reason behind the module concept

The idea of a module is to use it to encapsulate a piece of code into a useful unit. In achieving that goal, a module needs to be able to register its capability/export a value for the module and refer to other units of code.

The two most popular JavaScript module definition API (i.e. format) are CommonJS and AMD.
