## The problem 

The main characteristics of JavaScript include encapsulation, messy code, and dynamic type system.

### Dynamic type system

The good: 
- variables can hold any type of object e.g. boolean, string, number, object literal etc. 
- Types determined on the fy
- Implicit type coercion (ex: string to number)
    ```js
    // will be true
    '1' == 1
    ```

The Bad:
- Difficult to ensure proper types are passed without tests
- Not all developers use `===` e.g. telling JavaScript to not coerce a type such as string `"1"` into a number `1`
- Enterprise-scale apps can have 1000s of lines of code to maintain. 

Solution for the problem include
 - Write better JavaScript and apply various patterns
 - TypeScript 
 - CoffeeScript 
 - Dart

One can write in Dart or CoffeeScript and output JavaScript. But TypeScript is JavaScript (a superset of JavaScript).

```
All programming languages are doing the same thing. But they exist on different layers. For example, both Java and .NET are one level above c and c++. c/c++ is above assembly, which is above machine code. 
```

## What is TypeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 

Ecosystem 
- Any broser,
- Any host such as node, 
- Any OS,
- Open source,
- Tool support e.g. Sublime, VS, VS Code etc.

Features: 
- Supports standard JavaScript code,
- Static typing so we can catch incorrect data types through either tooling, compilation process or after fact i.e. unit testing, 
- Encapsulation through classes and modules,
- Support for constructors, properties, functions, 
- Interfaces defining the mimimum members that a particular type must have
- Arrow functions `=>`
- Intellisense and syntax checking if using supported editor

## Keywords and Operators
| Keyword                 | Description
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| **class**               | Container for members such as properties and functions | 
| **constructor**         | Provides initialization functionality in a class |
| **exports**             | Export a member from a module |
| **extends**             | Extend a class or interface |
| **implements**          | Implement an interface |
| **imports**             | Import a module |
| **interface**           | Defnes code contract that can be implemented by types |
| **module / namespace**  | Naming container for classes and other code |
| **public/private**      | Member visibility modifers |
| **â€¦**                   | Rest parameter syntax |
| **=>**                  | Arrow syntax used with defnitions and functions |
| **< typeName>**         | < > characters use to cast/convert between types |
| **:**                   | Separator between variable/parameter names and types |


Code Hierarchy in TypeScript is as following:

## Tooling and Framework Options
- Node.js (server side framework)
- Sublime, Emacs, Vi, VS (including auto compling into JavaScript upon saving a TypeScript file), VS Code, Atom, and WebStorm
