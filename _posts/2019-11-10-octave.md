## What is Octave

A high level programming language for quickly prototyping and developing machine learning algorithms. Once the algorithms have been developed, they can be properly implemented in other programming languages such as C++, Java etc.

## Installation

On Ubuntu, run

```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install octave```

## Common Commands

Documentation can be found here [https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/). Some common commands are,

- `octave` starts the interpreter
- `help <functionname>` displays documentation for a built in function. For example, `help plot` will bring up help information for plotting.

### Basic operators,

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- `==`  - equality operator
- `~=` - inequality operator
- `&&` - the AND logical operator
- `||` - the OR logical operator
- `xor(<number>, <number>)` - the XOR operator

### Other keywords,

- `%` - comment
- `;` - supress the print output
- `0` means false and all other numbers mean true

### Functions

- `PS1('>> ');` - change the octave prompt
- `disp()` - print the value of a variable, or a string
- `sprintf('something %0.2f', pi)` - print optional arguments under the control of the template string template and returns a string
- `format` or `format options` such as `format long`, `format short` etc. changes the number of characters to be displayed
- `sqrt()`
- `hist()` plot a histogram
- `size(A)` or `size(A, DIM)` return a row vector with the size (number of elements) of each dimension for the object A. When given a second argument, DIM, return the size of the corresponding dimension.
- `length()` Return the length of the object A. The length is 0 for empty objects, 1 for scalars, and the number of elements for vectors.  For matrix or N-dimensional objects, the length is the number of elements along the largest dimension (equivalent to 'max (size (A))').

Implementation of bash commands

- `pwd` shows the current working directory
- `cd`
- `ls`

### Common tasks

- `a = 1`, `a = pi` - define variable a and assign it a number
- `a = 'hi'` - string assignment

### Matrix

Define a matrix

- `A = [1, 2; 3 4; 5 6;]` defines a 3 x 2 matrix
- `A = [1 2 3;]` defines a 1 x 3 matrix
- `A = ones(2, 3)` generates a 2 x 3 matrix of all ones
- `A = zeros(2, 3)` generates a 2 x 3 matrix of all zeros
- `A = rand(2, 3)` generates a 2 x 3 matrix of random numbers drawn uniformly between 0 and 1
- `A = randn(2, 3)` generates a 2 x 3 matrix of random numbers drawn from gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance one
- `eye(4)` - generates a 4 x 4 identity matrix

Define a vector

- `v = [1; 2; 3;]` defines a vector
- `v = 1:0.1:2` defines a row vector (also 1 x 11 matrix), with each number increasing by 0.1
- `v = 1:6` defines a row vector (also 1 x 6 matrix)

## Move data around

Load data from file and save data to disk,

- `load file` or `load('<filename>.ext')` loads a file
- `who` shows the variables in memory
- `whos` shows the variables in memory with more details
- `clear` or `clear <variable_name>` to remove all variables or a particular variable from the memory
- `<vector_name>(1:10)` takes the first 10 rows of the vector
- `save <filename>.mat <variable_name>` save values in variable to file on disk
- `save <filename>.txt <variable_name> -asci` save values in variable to file on disk that is human readable

Data indexing,

- `<matrix_variable>(1, 2)` get the value at row 1 and column 2
- `<matrix_variable>(2, :)` get the all values in the second row
- `<matrix_variable>(:, 2)` get the all values in the second column
- `<matrix_variable>([1, 3], :)` from row 1 and row 3, get all columns
- `<matrix_variable>(:, 2) = [1; 2; 3;]` replace the second column with the new vector
- `A = [A, [100; 101; 102]]` append a vector to the right of matrix A
- `A(:)` put all elements of A into a single column vector
- `C = [A B]` or `C = [A, B]` concatinating A and B by putting B on the right side of A
- `C = [A : B]` concatinating A and B by putting B at the bottom of A
