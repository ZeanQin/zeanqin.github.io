I work in tech. When learning new things, I always find that researching a particular topic leads me to another topic which then leads me to other topics. And it's hard to track them all. The main purpose of the site is to build such a knowledge network to help me remembering things. I also put some of my practices, such as .vmrc, manuals such as setting up apache servers etc on the site. Together, I use this site to build my own knowledge graph.

In addition, it contains my resume and portofolios.
